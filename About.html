 		There are too many people transitioning too early into Heaven. Not necessarily because they're wicked, but they may have violated God's Universal Laws. Eating and drinking unhealthy foods and drinks that subtracts from your health equals poor health. Your body is fighting to heal and repair itself, but you must help it. I know it's not easy, but it is worth it. Excellent health will lengthen your life and quality of life. I don't want any of you laying on your deathbed crying wishing you would have done better. Your body warns you, your body is begging you to help it.</p>
          <p>
          To fulfill your Purpose you must be healthy (remember Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago, the people loved him and he was making great changes in Chicago, but he died prematurely). You Must be healthy to fulfill your Purpose. Your children (child) needs you. Stop making excuses and start today! Let's start on the path toward wholeness together.
